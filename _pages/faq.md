<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h3>Where is the site?</h3>
<p>         The site is located along the western coast of the Sakonnet River, approximately 500 feet north of Glen Manor house in roughly 5-15 feet of water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why was this site chosen?</h3>
<p>This area of the Sakonnet River was chosen for a few reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Biophysical modeling efforts conducted by a team of oceanographers highlighted that this area of the Sakonnet would be ideal for oyster culturing.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I further refined the site to be located well north of the Glen Manor House dock and tucked in relatively close to shore to minimize navigational hazards.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How will the project effect water quality?</h3>
<p>Oyster aquaculture has well known and well documented benefits to water quality and the marine ecosystem as a whole.  Oysters filter naturally occurring algae from the water and require no additives in order to thrive.  An adult oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day, which considerably increases the surrounding water quality.  More information about this is presented <a href="https://ecsga.org/sustainability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>When/how will you tend to the proposed farm?</h3>
<p>Myself and a crew of 1-2 aquaculturists will tend the farm by boat (23-foot center console), roughly 2-3 times a week. We aim to avoid working at the site on weekends and holidays.</p>
