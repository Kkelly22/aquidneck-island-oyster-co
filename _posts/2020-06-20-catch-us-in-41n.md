Looking for a good read about our local working waterfront?  Pick up the latest issue of 41°N Magazine, featuring 'Cage Fight - Oyster Growers Work Through The Path Of Lease Resistance', which covers some of the hardships that often come with obtaining an aquaculture lease.

In the article, Dan recalls his experience with the leasing process, and recommends discussion and education as a path forward. Dan is in good company, as fellow RI oyster farmers outline their experience over the years, and weigh in on why they feel aquaculture is a sustainable industry of the future.  Amidst the lease battles, one thing is for sure -- we can all sit down and share a tray of beautiful, locally sourced oysters.
