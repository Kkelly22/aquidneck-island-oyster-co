Curious about oysters, but not sure if you can dive right into the raw deal?  Grilling oysters is a great way to dip your toes into the world of oysters without fully committing to entirely raw seafood.  Think clams casino, but for oysters!  And not only are grilled oysters extremely tasty, but you can experiment with a ton of different flavor profiles.

Take a lesson from a seasoned chef like Ina Garten, and start with <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/grilled-oysters-with-lemon-dill-butter-6614217">this</a> as a base recipe.  In short:
<ol>
 	<li>Set your grill temp to medium/high.</li>
 	<li>Shuck your oysters, leaving the meat and liquor in the bottom shell.</li>
 	<li>Whip your favorite herbs and flavors into butter, and drop a dollop of the butter mixture onto each oyster.</li>
 	<li>Place each oyster carefully onto the grill, close the lid, and grill for approximately 3 minutes.  The liquor and butter should be just about bubbling when they are ready to come off.</li>
 	<li>Sprinkle any extra ingredients of your choosing to top them off (Ina recommends fresh sea salt, but bacon or fresh herbs never hurt anybody).</li>
</ol>
The best part about this recipe is you can't really go wrong.  Experiment and have fun with it!  The last time we made grilled oysters we whipped up some dill, minced garlic, salt, and pepper into butter, sprinkled the oysters with parmesan cheese, and then topped the oysters with chopped bacon and fresh green onion once they were off the grill.

Throughout this process, be sure to handle the oysters with care.  You don't want any of the liquor to spill out in transit or once on the grill.  Ina recommends using tin foil to help, but we've found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outset-76471-Stainless-Grillable-Metallic/dp/B07N4MJKFV/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=metal+oyster+shells&amp;qid=1600387203&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFFTzZIRkxRUkVEUTQmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAzMzExNzkyVEZSUzBHSTYyN1QzJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0NTgxMjUyWDM4MldEOVRWVTZCJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==">these</a> pretty handy.

And there you have it!  Happy grilling.
